# Defeater explanations
Use of defeasible reasoning to explain uncertainty and an implementation using Bayesian networks

## About
The repo uses [PyAgrum](https://pyagrum.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) network implementations to run. It is currently being moved to [ProbExplainer](https://github.com/Enrique-Val/ProbExplainer/) for better generalisation with other types of networks and with (future) better documentation

All the code needed is included in the folder "defeater_explanations" and a notebook containing a brief tutorial and the experiments done for the [International Journal of Approximate Reasoning](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijar.2023.108965) can be found as well
